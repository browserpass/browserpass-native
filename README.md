## Installation

### Install via package manager

The following operating systems provide a browserpass package that can be installed using a package manager:

-   Arch Linux: [browserpass](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/browserpass/)
-   Gentoo Linux: [browserpass](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/www-plugins/browserpass)
-   Debian: [browserpass](https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/browserpass)
-   NixOS: [browserpass](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/tools/security/browserpass/default.nix) - also read [Install on Nix / NixOS](#install-on-nix--nixos)
-   macOS: [browserpass](https://github.com/Amar1729/homebrew-formulae/blob/master/browserpass.rb) in a user-contributed tap [amar1729/formulae](https://github.com/amar1729/homebrew-formulae)

Once the package is installed, **refer to the section [Configure browsers](#configure-browsers)**.

If your OS is not listed above, proceed with the manual installation steps below.

### Install manually

Download [the latest Github release](https://github.com/browserpass/browserpass-native/releases), choose either the source code archive (if you want to compile the app yourself) or an archive for your operating system (it contains a pre-built binary).

All release files are signed with a PGP key that is available on [maximbaz.com](https://maximbaz.com/), [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/maximbaz) and various OpenPGP key servers. First, import the public key using any of these commands:

```
$ curl https://maximbaz.com/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
$ curl https://keybase.io/maximbaz/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
$ gpg --recv-keys EB4F9E5A60D32232BB52150C12C87A28FEAC6B20
```

To verify the signature of a given file, use `$ gpg --verify <file>.asc`.

It should report:

```
gpg: Signature made ...
gpg:                using RSA key 8053EB88879A68CB4873D32B011FDC52DA839335
gpg: Good signature from "Maxim Baz <...>"
gpg:                 aka ...
Primary key fingerprint: EB4F 9E5A 60D3 2232 BB52  150C 12C8 7A28 FEAC 6B20
     Subkey fingerprint: 8053 EB88 879A 68CB 4873  D32B 011F DC52 DA83 9335
```

If you are on Windows, just run the installer, it will install all the necessary files in `C:\Program Files\Browserpass` and it will also [configure browsers](#configure-browsers). You are done!

Unpack the archive. If you decided to compile the application yourself, refer to the [Building the app](#building-the-app) section on how to do so. Once complete, continue with the steps below.

If you are on macOS, first install the necessary tools: `brew install coreutils gnu-sed`.

If you are on FreeBSD, first install the GNU tools: `pkg install coreutils gmake gsed'.` Use `gmake` in place of `make` below.

If you downloaded a release archive with pre-compiled binary, follow these steps to install the app:

```
# IMPORTANT: replace XXXX with OS name depending on the archive you downloaded, e.g. "linux64"
make BIN=browserpass-XXXX configure      # Configure the hosts json files
sudo make BIN=browserpass-XXXX install   # Install the app
```

In addition, both `configure` and `install` targets respect `PREFIX`, `DESTDIR` parameters if you want to customize the install location (e.g. to install to a `$HOME` dir to avoid using `sudo`).

For example, if you are on macOS or FreeBSD, you probably want to install Browserpass in `/usr/local/bin`, therefore you need to run:

```
make BIN=browserpass-darwin64 PREFIX=/usr/local configure      # Configure the hosts json files
sudo make BIN=browserpass-darwin64 PREFIX=/usr/local install   # Install the app
```

If you compiled the app yourself, you can omit `BIN` parameter:

```
make configure      # Configure the hosts json files
sudo make install   # Install the app
```

Finally proceed to the [Configure browsers](#configure-browsers) section.

#### Install on Nix / NixOS

For a declarative NixOS installation, update your channel with `sudo nix-channel --update`, use the following to your `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` and rebuild your system:

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  programs.browserpass.enable = true;
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    # All of these browsers will work
    chromium firefox google-chrome vivaldi
    # firefox*-bin versions do *not* work with this. If you require such Firefox versions, use the stateful setup described below.
  ];
}
```

For a stateful Nix setup, update your channel, install Browserpass and link the necessary files with the Makefile (see [Configure browsers](#configure-browsers) section), but pass `DESTDIR=~/.nix-profile`:

```bash
$ nix-channel --update
$ nix-env -iA nixpkgs.browserpass # Or nix-env -iA nixos.browserpass on NixOS
$ DESTDIR=~/.nix-profile make -f ~/.nix-profile/lib/browserpass/Makefile <desired make goal>
```

#### Install on Windows through WSL

If you want to use WSL instead, follow Linux installation steps, then create `%localappdata%\Browserpass\browserpass-wsl.bat` with the following contents:

```
@echo off
bash -c "/usr/bin/browserpass-linux64 2>/dev/null"
```

Then edit the hosts json files (in our example `C:\Program Files\Browserpass\browser-files\*-host.json`) and replace `%%replace%%` with a full path to `browserpass-wsl.bat` you've just created.

Finally proceed to the [Configure browsers on Windows](#configure-browsers-on-windows) section.

Remember to check [Hints for configuring gpg](#hints-for-configuring-gpg) on how to configure pinentry to unlock your PGP key.

### Configure browsers

The following operating systems provide packages for certain browsers that can be installed using a package manager:

-   Arch Linux: [browserpass-chromium](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/browserpass-chromium/) and [browserpass-firefox](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/browserpass-firefox/)
    -   AUR: [browserpass-chrome](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/browserpass-chrome/)

If you installed a distro package above, you are done!

If something went wrong, if there's no package for your OS and/or a browser of your choice, or for whatever reason you just don't want to use them, proceed with the steps below.

First, enter the directory with installed Browserpass, by default it is `/usr/lib/browserpass/`, but if you used `PREFIX` or `DESTDIR` when running `make install`, it might be different for you. For example, on macOS the directory is likely to be `/usr/local/lib/browserpass/`.

See below the list of available `make` goals to configure various browsers. Use `gmake` on FreeBSD in place of `make`.

**It is recommended to use `*-user` make goals**, as more people had luck with them. But if they don't work as expected, try other available goals.

If you provided `PREFIX` and/or `DESTDIR` while running `make install`, remember that you must provide the same parameters, for example `make PREFIX=/usr/local hosts-chromium-user`:

| Command                    | Description                                                                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `make test`                  | Run tests                           |

### Build using Docker

First build the docker image using the following command in the project root:

```shell
docker build -t browserpass-native .
```

The entry point in the docker image is the `make` command. To run it:

```shell
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/src browserpass-native
```

Specify `make` goal(s) as the last parameter, for example:

```shell
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/src browserpass-native test
```

Refer to the list of available `make` goals above.

## Updates

If you installed the app using a package manager for your OS, you will likely update it in the same way.

If you installed manually, repeat the steps in the [Install manually](#install-manually) section.

## FAQ

### Hints for configuring gpg

First make sure `gpg` and some `pinentry` are installed.

-   on macOS many people succeeded with `pinentry-mac`
-   on Windows WSL people succeded with [pinentry-wsl-ps1](https://github.com/diablodale/pinentry-wsl-ps1)

Then ensure that `gpg-agent` process is actually running, if not you need to investigate how to enable it.

Finally configure a GUI pinentry program in `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`:

```
pinentry-program /full/path/to/pinentry
```

If Browserpass is unable to locate the proper `gpg` binary, try configuring a full path to your `gpg` in the browser extension settings or in `.browserpass.json` file in the root of your password store:

```json
{
    "gpgPath": "/full/path/to/gpg"
}
```
