-   TODO
-   TODO

Once the package is installed, refer to the section [Configure browsers](#configure-browsers).

If your OS is not listed above, proceed with the manual installation steps below.

### Install manually

Download [the latest Github release](https://github.com/browserpass/browserpass-native/releases), choose either the source code archive (if you want to compile the app yourself) or an archive for your operating system (it contains a pre-built binary).

All release files are signed with [this PGP key](https://keybase.io/maximbaz). To verify the signature of a given file, use `$ gpg --verify <file>.sig`.

It should report:

```
gpg: Signature made ...
gpg:                using RSA key 8053EB88879A68CB4873D32B011FDC52DA839335
gpg: Good signature from "Maxim Baz <...>"
gpg:                 aka ...
Primary key fingerprint: EB4F 9E5A 60D3 2232 BB52  150C 12C8 7A28 FEAC 6B20
     Subkey fingerprint: 8053 EB88 879A 68CB 4873  D32B 011F DC52 DA83 9335
```

Unpack the archive. If you decided to compile the application yourself, refer to the [Building the app](#building-the-app) section on how to do so. Once complete, continue with the steps below.

Finally install the app using `make install` (if you compiled it using `make browserpass`) or `make BIN=browserpass-XXXX install` (if you downloaded a release with pre-built binary).

### Build using Docker

First build the docker image using the following command in the project root:

```shell
docker build -t browserpass-native .
```

The entry point in the docker image is the `make` command. To run it:

```shell
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/src browserpass-native
```

Specify `make` goal(s) as the last parameter, for example:

```shell
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/src browserpass-native test
```

Refer to the list of available `make` goals above.

## Updates

If you installed the app using a package manager for your OS, you will likely update it in the same way.

If you installed manually, repeat the steps in the [Install manually](#install-manually) section.
